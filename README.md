# Practice for React and Redux
#### React.js is a JavaScript library. It was developed by engineers at Facebook.

#### REACT Overview

* React is fast. Apps made in React can handle complex updates and still feel quick and responsive.

* React is modular. Instead of writing large, dense files of code, devs can write many smaller, reusable files. React's modularity can be a solution to JavaScript's maintainability problems.

* React is scalable. Large programs that display a lot of changing data are where React performs best.

* React is flexible. React can be used for interesting projects that have nothing to do with making a web app. People are still figuring out React's potential. There's room to explore.

* React is popular. While this reason has admittedly little to do with React's quality, the truth is that understanding React will make you more employable.
